Handshaker is a WordPress theme built to display art in progress for any aspiring artist. Handshaker showcases art in progress, a digital gallery of previously completed artwork, curatorial submission requests, awards received. There is a section for introducing the artist and the organization (if any) that the artist is associated with. It also features a section for sponsors and (social media) links. It is based on the Sage starter theme. <a href="https://github.com/quilombolaengineering/handshaker.git">Contribute on GitHub</a>.
